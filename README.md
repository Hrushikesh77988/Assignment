<h2>Credits</h2>
Thanks to Mind Bowser for giving me the opportunity to develop this app <br/>

<h2>Experience</h2>
Working on a idea from scratch from design to implementation of the application and freedom the design the app was really great experience. Also working on a limited time, although I am happy about how the app turned out.<br/>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<br>
At start while designing the application I sougth forward to list the employee details on a simple popup window which would make a better sense to add and update the employee details. So the implementation of data into a model popup window using bootstrap was challenging as there were new terms (model) to learn in this technology.
